# UNVEILING CROSS-SECTORAL DYNAMICS  AND TRENDS: ANALYZING THE INDIAN  STARTUP ECOSYSTEM THROUGH  STRUCTURAL TOPIC MODELLING

### Abstract
India is witnessing an unprecedented growth within the startup landscape, as it continues to solidify its position 
as a major global centre for innovation and entrepreneurship. This research paper aims to uncover the latent 
sectoral topics and analyse trends in the Indian startup ecosystem using Structural Topic Modelling (STM). 
The analysis leverages company descriptions from LinkedInâ€™s About section, along with a rich meta-data, of 
661 startup companies, founded between 2018-2023. The study uncovers a growing multidisciplinary nature 
of startups among top-funded sectors, driven by digital and AI technologies, and identifies emerging trends 
such as the expanding presence of Ecommerce, Edtech and Agritech beyond Tier 1 cities. The findings of this 
study can potentially inform policymakers, investors, and entrepreneurs seeking to navigate the evolving
landscape of the Indian startup ecosystem.
